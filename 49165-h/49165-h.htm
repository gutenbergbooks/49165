<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c003'>JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had
a visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. He
had no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there
were pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman
had flagged him as he came in from the street: “A thousand
pardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman—he would leave no
name. He said you’d want to see him. He will be back by
eight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring
about the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the
Red Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in
number. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew
vaguely—Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over
near the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped
the first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron
returned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and
waited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time
without justifying it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat
down at Baron’s table. He was short and wiry. His face held
no key to his age—he might have been thirty or a thousand—but
he looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and
forehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still
healing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The stranger said, “I’m glad you waited. I’ve heard you’re
planning to attempt the Brightside.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Baron stared at the man for a moment. “I see you can read
telecasts,” he said coldly. “The news was correct. We are going
to make a Brightside Crossing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“At perihelion?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course. When else?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The grizzled man searched Baron’s face for a moment
without expression. Then he said slowly, “No, I’m afraid you’re
not going to make the Crossing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say, who are you, if you don’t mind?” Baron demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The name is Claney,” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a silence. Then: “Claney? <i>Peter</i> Claney?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Baron’s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger
gone. “Great balls of fire, man—<i>where have you been hiding?</i>
We’ve been trying to contact you for months!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know. I was hoping you’d quit looking and chuck the
whole idea.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quit looking!” Baron bent forward over the table. “My
friend, we’d given up hope, but we’ve never quit looking.
Here, have a drink. There’s so much you can tell us.” His
fingers were trembling.</p>

<p class='c004'>Peter Claney shook his head. “I can’t tell you anything you
want to hear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you’ve <i>got</i> to. You’re the only man on Earth who’s
attempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And the
story you cleared for the news—it was nothing. We need
<i>details</i>. Where did your equipment fall down? Where did you
miscalculate? What were the trouble spots?” Baron jabbed a
finger at Claney’s face. “That, for instance—epithelioma?
Why? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We’ve
got to know those things. If you can tell us, we can make
it across where your attempt failed—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You want to know why we failed?” asked Claney.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course we want to know. We <i>have</i> to know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s simple. We failed because it can’t be done. We couldn’t
do it and neither can you. No human beings will ever cross
the Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nonsense,” Baron declared. “We will.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Claney shrugged. “I was there. I know what I’m saying. You
can blame the equipment or the men—there were flaws in
both quarters—but we just didn’t know what we were fighting.
It was the <i>planet</i> that whipped us, that and the <i>Sun</i>. They’ll
whip you, too, if you try it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never,” said Baron.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me tell you,” Peter Claney said.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>I’d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as
I can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when
Wyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt—that was in 2082,
I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then
I was heartbroken when they just disappeared.</p>

<p class='c004'>I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without
proper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface
conditions, without any charts—they couldn’t have made
a hundred miles—but I didn’t know that then and it was a
terrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson’s work in the
Twilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my
blood, sure as death.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it was Mikuta’s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever
know Tom Mikuta? I don’t suppose you did. No, not Japanese—Polish-American.
He was a major in the Interplanetary Service
for some years and hung onto the title after he gave up
his commission.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,
did a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for
the Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five
years together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring
since the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan
Crater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.</p>

<p class='c004'>I’d always liked the Major—he was big and quiet and cool,
the sort of guy who always had things figured a little further
ahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight
place. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,
with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind
of personality that could take a crew of wild men and
make them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand
miles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at
first. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about
old times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he’d
been out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,
and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the
year—and then he wanted to know what I’d been doing since
Venus and what my plans were.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No particular plans,” I told him. “Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked me over. “How much do you weigh, Peter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>I told him one-thirty-five.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That much!” he said. “Well, there can’t be much fat on
you, at any rate. How do you take heat?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You should know,” I said. “Venus was no icebox.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I mean <i>real</i> heat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then I began to get it. “You’re planning a trip.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s right. A hot trip.” He grinned at me. “Might be
dangerous, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What trip?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Brightside of Mercury,” the Major said.</p>

<p class='c004'>I whistled cautiously. “At aphelion?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He threw his head back. “Why try a Crossing at aphelion?
What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous
heat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and
drum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four
days later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense
about it.” He leaned across me eagerly. “I want to make
a Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If
a man can do that, he’s got Mercury. Until then, <i>nobody’s</i> got
Mercury. I want Mercury—but I’ll need help getting it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I’d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider
it. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury
turns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around
the Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.
That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest
place in the Solar System, with one single exception: the
surface of the Sun itself.</p>

<p class='c004'>It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned
just <i>how</i> hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It
was a real hell’s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody
would cross it.</p>

<p class='c004'>I wanted to be along.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the
obvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn’t very extensive—a
rocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson’s
crew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed
the Solar ’scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years
before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Twilight Lab wasn’t particularly interested in the Brightside,
of course—the Sun was Sanderson’s baby and he’d picked
Mercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could
hold his observatory. He’d chosen a good location, too. On
Mercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770° F. at perihelion
and the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410° F. No permanent
installation with a human crew could survive at either
extreme. But with Mercury’s wobble, the twilight zone between
Brightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival
temperatures.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone
is about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to
60 degrees with the libration. The Solar ’scope could take that
much change and they’d get good clear observation of the Sun
for about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet
to wheel around.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something
about Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab
to make final preparations.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sanderson did. He thought we’d lost our minds and he said
so, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week
briefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had
arrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.
Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson
had given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside
was like.</p>

<p class='c004'>Stone was a youngster—hardly twenty-five, I’d say—but
he’d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join
this trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn’t care for
exploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed
him around like a puppy.</p>

<p class='c004'>It didn’t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting
in for. You don’t go asking people in this game why they do it—they’re
liable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can
ever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had
borrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and
equipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check
and test.</p>

<p class='c004'>We dug right in. With plenty of funds—tri-V money and
some government cash the Major had talked his way around—our
equipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing
and testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.
We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,
with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,
and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he
said, “Have you heard anything from McIvers?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who’s he?” Stone wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’ll be joining us. He’s a good man—got quite a name
for climbing, back home.” The Major turned to me. “You’ve
probably heard of him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I’d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn’t
too happy to hear that he was joining us. “Kind of a daredevil,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe. He’s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the
line? We’ll need plenty of both.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you ever worked with him?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. Are you worried?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major laughed. “I don’t think we need to worry about
McIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the
trip to him and we’re going to need each other too much to
do any fooling around.” He turned back to the supply list.
“Meanwhile, let’s get this stuff listed and packed. We’ll need
to cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says
we should leave in three days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Two days later, McIvers hadn’t arrived. The Major didn’t
say much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We
spent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as
they were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so
far out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They
showed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and
that was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline
of our course.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This range here,” the Major said as we crowded around
the board, “is largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But
these to the south and west <i>could</i> be active. Seismograph
tracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse
down toward the equator—not only volcanic, but sub-surface
shifting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Stone nodded. “Sanderson told me there was probably constant
surface activity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major shrugged. “Well, it’s treacherous, there’s no
doubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the
Pole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of
less activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could
find a pass through this range and cut sharp east—”</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the
further we got from a solution. We knew there were active
volcanoes on the Brightside—even on the Darkside, though
surface activity there was pretty much slowed down and
localized.</p>

<p class='c004'>But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as
well. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric
flow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much—the lighter gases
had reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside
millennia ago—but there was CO<sub>2</sub>, and nitrogen, and traces of
other heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur
vapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.</p>

<p class='c004'>The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it
condensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson
to estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on
Brightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage
that avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final
analysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way
we would find out what was happening where was to be there.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight
rocket from Venus. He’d missed the ship that the Major and
I had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus
in hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn’t seem too upset
about it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and
he couldn’t see why everyone should get so excited.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely
gray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber’s—half-closed,
sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.
And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing
something with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.</p>

<p class='c004'>Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his
arrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were
running the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,
Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was
set for an early departure after we got some rest.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>“And that,” said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling
the waiter for another pair, “was your first big mistake.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Peter Claney raised his eyebrows. “McIvers?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Claney shrugged, glanced at the small quiet tables around
them. “There are lots of bizarre personalities around a place
like this, and some of the best wouldn’t seem to be the most
reliable at first glance. Anyway, personality problems weren’t
our big problem right then. <i>Equipment</i> worried us first and
<i>route</i> next.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Baron nodded in agreement. “What kind of suits did you
have?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The best insulating suits ever made,” said Claney. “Each
one had an inner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid
the clumsiness of asbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit
and oxygen storage which we recharged from the sledges every
eight hours. Outer layer carried a monomolecular chrome reflecting
surface that made us glitter like Christmas trees. And
we had a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between
the two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course—at
770 degrees, it wouldn’t take much time to fry us to cinders
if the suits failed somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How about the Bugs?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They were insulated, too, but we weren’t counting on
them too much for protection.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You weren’t!” Baron exclaimed. “Why not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’d be in and out of them too much. They gave us mobility
and storage, but we knew we’d have to do a lot of
forward work on foot.” Claney smiled bitterly. “Which meant
that we had an inch of fiberglass and a half-inch of dead air
between us and a surface temperature where lead flowed like
water and zinc was almost at melting point and the pools of
sulfur in the shadows were boiling like oatmeal over a campfire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Baron licked his lips. His fingers stroked the cool, wet glass
as he set it down on the tablecloth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go on,” he said tautly. “You started on schedule?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, yes,” said Claney, “we started on schedule, all right.
We just didn’t quite end on schedule, that was all. But I’m
getting to that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He settled back in his chair and continued.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast
with thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we
could cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit
Center exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury’s closest
approach to the Sun—which made Center the hottest part of
the planet at the hottest it ever gets.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon
when we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day
that Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the
surface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job
was only half done—we would still have to travel another
two thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson
was to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory’s scout ship,
approximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.</p>

<p class='c004'>That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those
seventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter
what terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and
time-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew
that.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.
“Peter, you’ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped
down for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving
you a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you’ll have the job of
dragging the sledges, so we’ll have to direct your course pretty
closely. Peter’s job is to pick the passage at any given point.
If there’s any doubt of safe passage, we’ll all explore ahead
on foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: “Jack
and I were planning to change around. We figured he could
take the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major looked up sharply at Stone. “Do you buy that,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Stone shrugged. “I don’t mind. Mac wanted—”</p>

<p class='c004'>McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. “It
doesn’t matter. I just feel better when I’m on the move. Does
it make any difference?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess it doesn’t,” said the Major. “Then you’ll flank
Peter along with me. Right?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure, sure.” McIvers pulled at his lower lip. “Who’s going
to do the advance scouting?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It sounds like I am,” I cut in. “We want to keep the lead
Bug light as possible.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mikuta nodded. “That’s right. Peter’s Bug is stripped down
to the frame and wheels.”</p>

<p class='c004'>McIvers shook his head. “No, I mean the <i>advance</i> work.
You need somebody out ahead—four or five miles, at least—to
pick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don’t you?”
He stared at the Major. “I mean, how can we tell what sort of
a hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up
ahead?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s what we have the charts for,” the Major said
sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Charts! I’m talking about <i>detail</i> work. We don’t need to
worry about the major topography. It’s the little faults you
can’t see on the pictures that can kill us.” He tossed the charts
down excitedly. “Look, let me take a Bug out ahead and work
reconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.
I can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the
area closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.
Then—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No dice,” the Major broke in.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why not? We could save ourselves days!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t care what we could save. We stay together. When
we get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That
means we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any
climber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man
alone—any time, any place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he
gave a sullen nod. “Okay. If you say so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I say so and I mean it. I don’t want any fancy stuff.
We’re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.
Got that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and
we nodded, too.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” he said slowly. “Now that we’ve got it straight,
let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I’ll
never forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a
break, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the
first few days would be the easiest and we were rested and
fresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of
the Twilight Lab.</p>

<p class='c004'>I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the
Major and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires
taking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,
Stone dragged the sledges.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on
the big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic
ash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for
the first twenty miles.</p>

<p class='c004'>I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out
the track the early research teams had made out into the edge
of Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson’s
little outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We
were in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to
bite.</p>

<p class='c004'>We didn’t <i>feel</i> the heat so much those first days out. We <i>saw</i>
it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five
degrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched
that glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and
some nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured
sweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.</p>

<p class='c004'>We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period
came due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up
a light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.
The sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy
degrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the
forward sledge—sucking through tubes—protein, carbohydrates,
bulk gelatin, vitamins.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because
we’d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.
We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists
and psychiatrists why—they can give you have a dozen interesting
reasons—but all we knew, or cared about, was that it
happened to be so.</p>

<p class='c004'>We didn’t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our
eyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,
but we couldn’t sleep them off. We sat around looking
at each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would
taste, and off we’d go. We’d have murdered our grandmothers
for one ice-cold bottle of beer.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at
the wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made
Earth’s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.
Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,
with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled
with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous
gases.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but
the challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one
had ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had
tried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,
so it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed
the hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land
could throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet we knew that even the land might have been conquered
before, except for that Sun. We’d fought absolute cold before
and won. We’d never fought heat like this and won. The only
worse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun
itself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would
get us. That was the bargain.</p>

<p class='c004'>I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.
The gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved
onto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and
east. This range had shown no activity since the first landing
on Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active
cones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their
sides were shrouded with heavy ash.</p>

<p class='c004'>We couldn’t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot,
sulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the
face of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters
rose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and
rubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing
from the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray
dust—silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite
ash, filling crevices and declivities—offering a soft, treacherous
surface for the Bug’s pillow tires.</p>

<p class='c004'>I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the
sag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it
from an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to
a halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with
light copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more
until we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It
was cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,
at first.</p>

<p class='c004'>Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to
think so, too.</p>

<p class='c004'>McIvers’ restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.
He talked too much, while we were resting or while we were
driving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin
with repetition. He took to making side trips from the route
now and then, never far, but a little further each time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with
each stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn’t like it, but
I figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive
enough myself; I just managed to hide it better.</p>

<p class='c004'>And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in
the sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare
filters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached
constantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the
end of an eight-hour trek.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it took one of those side trips of McIvers’ to deliver the
penultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven
down a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our
route and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we
heard a sharp cry through our earphones.</p>

<p class='c004'>I wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and
spotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the
top of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down
the gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand
horrible pictures racing through our minds....</p>

<p class='c004'>We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge
and, for once, he didn’t have anything to say. It was the wreck
of a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort that
hadn’t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut in
the rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up the
middle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away were
two insulated suits with white bones gleaming through the
fiberglass helmets.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on <i>their</i>
Brightside Crossing.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>On the fifth driving period out, the terrain began to change.
It looked the same, but every now and then it <i>felt</i> different.
On two occasions I felt my wheels spin, with a howl of protest
from my engine. Then, quite suddenly, the Bug gave a lurch;
I gunned my motor and nothing happened.</p>

<p class='c004'>I could see the dull gray stuff seeping up around the hubs,
thick and tenacious, splattering around in steaming gobs as
the wheels spun. I knew what had happened the moment the
wheels gave and, a few minutes later, they chained me to the
tractor and dragged me back out of the mire. It looked for
all the world like thick gray mud, but it was a pit of molten
lead, steaming under a soft layer of concealing ash.</p>

<p class='c004'>I picked my way more cautiously then. We were getting into
an area of recent surface activity; the surface was really treacherous.
I caught myself wishing that the Major had okayed
McIvers’ scheme for an advanced scout; more dangerous for
the individual, maybe, but I was driving blind now and I didn’t
like it.</p>

<p class='c004'>One error in judgment could sink us all, but I wasn’t thinking
much about the others. I was worried about <i>me</i>, plenty
worried. I kept thinking, better McIvers should go than me.
It wasn’t healthy thinking and I knew it, but I couldn’t get the
thought out of my mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a grueling eight hours and we slept poorly. Back in
the Bug again, we moved still more slowly—edging out on a
broad flat plateau, dodging a network of gaping surface cracks—winding
back and forth in an effort to keep the machines on
solid rock. I couldn’t see far ahead, because of the yellow haze
rising from the cracks, so I was almost on top of it when I saw
a sharp cut ahead where the surface dropped six feet beyond
a deep crack.</p>

<p class='c004'>I let out a shout to halt the others; then I edged my Bug
forward, peering at the cleft. It was deep and wide. I moved
fifty yards to the left, then back to the right.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was only one place that looked like a possible crossing;
a long, narrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across
a section of the fault like a ramp. Even as I watched it, I could
feel the surface crust under the Bug trembling and saw the
ledge shift over a few feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major’s voice sounded in my ears. “How about it,
Peter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. This crust is on roller skates,” I called back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How about that ledge?”</p>

<p class='c004'>I hesitated. “I’m scared of it, Major. Let’s backtrack and try
to find a way around.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a roar of disgust in my earphones and McIvers’
Bug suddenly lurched forward. It rolled down past me, picked
up speed, with McIvers hunched behind the wheel like a race
driver. He was heading past me straight for the gray ledge.</p>

<p class='c004'>My shout caught in my throat; I heard the Major take a huge
breath and roar: “Mac! <i>stop that thing</i>, you fool!” and then
McIvers’ Bug was out on the ledge, lumbering across like a
juggernaut.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ledge jolted as the tires struck it; for a horrible moment,
it seemed to be sliding out from under the machine. And then
the Bug was across in a cloud of dust, and I heard McIvers’
voice in my ears, shouting in glee. “Come on, you slowpokes.
It’ll hold you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Something unprintable came through the earphones as the
Major drew up alongside me and moved his Bug out on the
ledge slowly and over to the other side. Then he said, “Take it
slow, Peter. Then give Jack a hand with the sledges.” His voice
sounded tight as a wire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ten minutes later, we were on the other side of the cleft.
The Major checked the whole column; then he turned on
McIvers angrily. “One more trick like that,” he said, “and I’ll
strap you to a rock and leave you. Do you understand me?
<i>One more time</i>—”</p>

<p class='c004'>McIvers’ voice was heavy with protest. “Good Lord, if we
leave it up to Claney, he’ll have us out here forever! Any blind
fool could see that that ledge would hold.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i>I</i> saw it moving,” I shot back at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, all right, so you’ve got good eyes. Why all the
fuss? We got across, didn’t we? But I say we’ve got to have a
little nerve and use it once in a while if we’re ever going to
get across this lousy hotbox.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We need to use a little judgment, too,” the Major snapped.
“All right, let’s roll. But if you think I was joking, you just try
me out once.” He let it soak in for a minute. Then he geared his
Bug on around to my flank again.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the stopover, the incident wasn’t mentioned again, but
the Major drew me aside just as I was settling down for sleep.
“Peter, I’m worried,” he said slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“McIvers? Don’t worry. He’s not as reckless as he seems—just
impatient. We are over a hundred miles behind schedule
and we’re moving awfully slow. We only made forty miles this
last drive.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major shook his head. “I don’t mean McIvers. I mean
the kid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jack? What about him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take a look.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Stone was shaking. He was over near the tractor—away
from the rest of us—and he was lying on his back, but he
wasn’t asleep. His whole body was shaking, convulsively. I saw
him grip an outcropping of rock hard.</p>

<p class='c004'>I walked over and sat down beside him. “Get your water all
right?” I said.</p>

<p class='c004'>He didn’t answer. He just kept on shaking.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hey, boy,” I said. “What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s hot,” he said, choking out the words.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure it’s hot, but don’t let it throw you. We’re in really
good shape.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i>We’re not</i>,” he snapped. “We’re in rotten shape, if you ask
me. <i>We’re not going to make it</i>, do you know that? That crazy
fool’s going to kill us for sure—” All of a sudden, he was
bawling like a baby. “I’m scared—I shouldn’t be here—I’m
<i>scared</i>. What am I trying to prove by coming out here, for
God’s sake? I’m some kind of hero or something? I tell you
I’m scared—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look,” I said. “Mikuta’s scared, <i>I’m</i> scared. So what? We’ll
make it, don’t worry. And nobody’s trying to be a hero.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nobody but Hero Stone,” he said bitterly. He shook himself
and gave a tight little laugh. “Some hero, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll make it,” I said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure,” he said finally. “Sorry. I’ll be okay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I rolled over, but waited until he was good and quiet. Then
I tried to sleep, but I didn’t sleep too well. I kept thinking about
that ledge. I’d known from the look of it what it was; a zinc
slough of the sort Sanderson had warned us about, a wide sheet
of almost pure zinc that had been thrown up white-hot from
below, quite recently, just waiting for oxygen or sulfur to rot
it through.</p>

<p class='c004'>I knew enough about zinc to know that at these temperatures
it gets brittle as glass. Take a chance like McIvers had
taken and the whole sheet could snap like a dry pine board.
And it wasn’t McIvers’ fault that it hadn’t.</p>

<p class='c004'>Five hours later, we were back at the wheel. We were hardly
moving at all. The ragged surface was almost impassable—great
jutting rocks peppered the plateau; ledges crumbled the
moment my tires touched them; long, open canyons turned into
lead-mires or sulfur pits.</p>

<p class='c004'>A dozen times I climbed out of the Bug to prod out an uncertain
area with my boots and pikestaff. Whenever I did,
McIvers piled out behind me, running ahead like a schoolboy
at the fair, then climbing back again red-faced and panting,
while we moved the machines ahead another mile or two.</p>

<p class='c004'>Time was pressing us now and McIvers wouldn’t let me forget
it. We had made only about three hundred twenty miles
in six driving periods, so we were about a hundred miles or
even more behind schedule.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’re not going to make it,” McIvers would complain
angrily. “That Sun’s going to be out to aphelion by the time
we hit the Center—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sorry, but I can’t take it any faster,” I told him. I was
getting good and mad. I knew what he wanted, but didn’t dare
let him have it. I was scared enough pushing the Bug out on
those ledges, even knowing that at least <i>I</i> was making the
decisions. Put him in the lead and we wouldn’t last for eight
hours. Our nerves wouldn’t take it, at any rate, even if the
machines would.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack Stone looked up from the aluminum chart sheets.
“Another hundred miles and we should hit a good stretch,”
he said. “Maybe we can make up distance there for a couple
of days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major agreed, but McIvers couldn’t hold his impatience.
He kept staring up at the Sun as if he had a personal grudge
against it and stamped back and forth under the sunshield.
“That’ll be just fine,” he said. “<i>If</i> we ever get that far, that is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>We dropped it there, but the Major stopped me as we
climbed aboard for the next run. “That guy’s going to blow
wide open if we don’t move faster, Peter. I don’t want him in
the lead, no matter what happens. He’s right though, about the
need to make better time. Keep your head, but crowd your
luck a little, okay?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll try,” I said. It was asking the impossible and Mikuta
knew it. We were on a long downward slope that shifted and
buckled all around us, as though there were a molten underlay
beneath the crust; the slope was broken by huge crevasses,
partly covered with dust and zinc sheeting, like a vast glacier
of stone and metal. The outside temperature registered 547° F.
and getting hotter. It was no place to start rushing ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>I tried it anyway. I took half a dozen shaky passages, edging
slowly out on flat zinc ledges, then toppling over and across.
It seemed easy for a while and we made progress. We hit an
even stretch and raced ahead. And then I quickly jumped on
my brakes and jerked the Bug to a halt in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p class='c004'>I’d gone too far. We were out on a wide, flat sheet of gray
stuff, apparently solid—until I’d suddenly caught sight of the
crevasse beneath in the corner of my eye. It was an overhanging
shell that trembled under me as I stopped.</p>

<p class='c004'>McIvers’ voice was in my ear. “What’s the trouble now,
Claney?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Move back!” I shouted. “It can’t hold us!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks solid enough from here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You want to argue about it? It’s too thin, it’ll snap. Move
back!”</p>

<p class='c004'>I started edging back down the ledge. I heard McIvers
swear; then I saw his Bug start to creep <i>outward</i> on the shelf.
Not fast or reckless, this time, but slowly, churning up dust in
a gentle cloud behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>I just stared and felt the blood rush to my head. It seemed
so hot I could hardly breathe as he edged out beyond me,
further and further—</p>

<p class='c004'>I think I felt it snap before I saw it. My own machine gave
a sickening lurch and a long black crack appeared across the
shelf—and widened. Then the ledge began to upend. I heard
a scream as McIvers’ Bug rose up and up and then crashed
down into the crevasse in a thundering slide of rock and
shattered metal.</p>

<p class='c004'>I just stared for a full minute, I think. I couldn’t move until
I heard Jack Stone groan and the Major shouting, “Claney! I
couldn’t see—what <i>happened</i>?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It snapped on him, that’s what happened,” I roared. I
gunned my motor, edged forward toward the fresh broken
edge of the shelf. The crevasse gaped; I couldn’t see any sign
of the machine. Dust was still billowing up blindingly from
below.</p>

<p class='c004'>We stood staring down, the three of us. I caught a glimpse
of Jack Stone’s face through his helmet. It wasn’t pretty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the Major heavily, “that’s that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess so.” I felt the way Stone looked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait,” said Stone. “I heard something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He had. It was a cry in the earphones—faint, but unmistakable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mac!” The Major called. “Mac, can you hear me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yeah, yeah. I can hear you.” The voice was very weak.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you all right?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. Broken leg, I think. It’s—hot.” There was a
long pause. Then: “I think my cooler’s gone out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major shot me a glance, then turned to Stone. “Get a
cable from the second sledge fast. He’ll fry alive if we don’t
get him out of there. Peter, I need you to lower me. Use the
tractor winch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I lowered him; he stayed down only a few moments. When
I hauled him up, his face was drawn. “Still alive,” he panted.
“He won’t be very long, though.” He hesitated for just an instant.
“We’ve got to make a try.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t like this ledge,” I said. “It’s moved twice since I got
out. Why not back off and lower him a cable?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No good. The Bug is smashed and he’s inside it. We’ll need
torches and I’ll need one of you to help.” He looked at me and
then gave Stone a long look. “Peter, you’d better come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait,” said Stone. His face was very white. “Let me go
down with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Peter is lighter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not so heavy. Let me go down.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Okay, if that’s the way you want it.” The Major tossed him
a torch. “Peter, check these hitches and lower us slowly. If
you see any kind of trouble, <i>anything</i>, cast yourself free and
back off this thing, do you understand? This whole ledge may
go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I nodded. “Good luck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They went over the ledge. I let the cable down bit by bit
until it hit two hundred feet and slacked off.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How does it look?” I shouted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bad,” said the Major. “We’ll have to work fast. This whole
side of the crevasse is ready to crumble. Down a little more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Minutes passed without a sound. I tried to relax, but I
couldn’t. Then I felt the ground shift, and the tractor lurched
to the side.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Major shouted, “<i>It’s going, Peter—pull back!</i>” and I
threw the tractor into reverse, jerked the controls as the tractor
rumbled off the shelf. The cable snapped, coiled up in front
like a broken clockspring. The whole surface under me was
shaking wildly now; ash rose in huge gray clouds. Then, with
a roar, the whole shelf lurched and slid sideways. It teetered
on the edge for seconds before it crashed into the crevasse,
tearing the side wall down with it in a mammoth slide. I
jerked the tractor to a halt as the dust and flame billowed up.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were gone—all three of them, McIvers and the Major
and Jack Stone—buried under a thousand tons of rock and
zinc and molten lead. There wasn’t any danger of anybody
ever finding their bones.</p>

<hr class='c005' />

<p class='c004'>Peter Claney leaned back, finishing his drink, rubbing his
scarred face as he looked across at Baron.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly, Baron’s grip relaxed on the chair arm. “<i>You</i> got
back,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Claney nodded. “I got back, sure. I had the tractor and the
sledges. I had seven days to drive back under that yellow Sun.
I had plenty of time to think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You took the wrong man along,” Baron said. “That was
your mistake. Without him you would have made it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never.” Claney shook his head. “That’s what I was thinking
the first day or so—that it was <i>McIvers’</i> fault, that <i>he</i> was to
blame. But that isn’t true. He was wild, reckless and had lots
of nerve.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But his judgment was bad!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It couldn’t have been sounder. We had to keep to our
schedule even if it killed us, because it would positively kill us
if we didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But a man like that—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A man like McIvers was necessary. Can’t you see that? It
was the Sun that beat us, that surface. Perhaps we were licked
the very day we started.” Claney leaned across the table, his
eyes pleading. “We didn’t realize that, but it was <i>true</i>. There
are places that men can’t go, conditions men can’t tolerate.
The others had to die to learn that. I was lucky, I came back.
But I’m trying to tell you what I found out—that <i>nobody</i> will
ever make a Brightside Crossing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We will,” said Baron. “It won’t be a picnic, but we’ll make
it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But suppose you do,” said Claney, suddenly. “Suppose I’m
all wrong, suppose you <i>do</i> make it. Then what? <i>What comes
next?</i>”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Sun,” said Baron.</p>

<p class='c004'>Claney nodded slowly. “Yes. That would be it, wouldn’t it?”
He laughed. “Good-by, Baron. Jolly talk and all that. Thanks
for listening.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Baron caught his wrist as he started to rise. “Just one question
more, Claney. Why did you come here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To try to talk you out of killing yourself,” said Claney.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re a liar,” said Baron.</p>

<p class='c004'>Claney stared down at him for a long moment. Then he
crumpled in the chair. There was defeat in his pale blue eyes
and something else.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Peter Claney spread his hands, a helpless gesture. “When
do you leave, Baron? I want you to take me along.”</p>
